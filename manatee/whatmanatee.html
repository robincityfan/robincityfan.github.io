 <p>Manatees have thick pads around their lips and beaver-like tails.</p>
 
 <p>They can swim at 5 to 10 kilometers per hour. They can dive for up to 15 minutes.</p>
 
 <p>Manatees are more closely related to hyraxes and elephants than they are to dolphins or whales.</p>
 
 <p>Manatees are one of the two types of Sirenians left on earth. 
 The other type of Sirenian is the Dugong.<p>
 
 <p>These are four or five manatee species</p>
